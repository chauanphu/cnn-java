# A Java Project that replicates the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to recognize image

This is a project that use fully-connected layers to train models.

## The data structures

- Tensor: store data and perform mathematical operations such as matrix multiplication and dot product.
- Layer: Neural Network's layer for training data.

## Algorithms

- Forward propagation
- Backward propagation

## How it works:

1. Firstly, the input will be a tensor with size (m: number of samples, n: number of features)
2. Run forward propagation:

    - Feed the data into the Input Layer.
